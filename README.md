A simple python wizard script that can quickly and easily generate a simple CRUD API using Flask and MongoDB while automatically including a functional Swagger UI upon completion.

Inspired by the simplicity of setting up a full CRUD API using LoopBack in node.js.  

Based on code in the tutorial found here:
https://medium.com/@ishmeet1995/how-to-create-restful-crud-api-with-python-flask-mongodb-and-docker-8f6ccb73c5bc

Simply execute the 'run_wizard.sh' file to begin and answer the prompts.

Make sure that the IP and Port you choose to broadcast the API on can be reached through any firewalls.

Have fun!
