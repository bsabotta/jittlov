# jittlov

A simple python wizard script that can quickly and easily generate a simple CRUD API using Flask and MongoDB while automatically including a functional Swagger UI upon completion.

Inspired by the simplicity of setting up a full CRUD API using LoopBack in node.js.

Simply execute the run_wizard.sh file to begin and answer the prompts.

Make sure that the IP and Port you choose to broadcast the API on can be reached through any firewalls.

Have fun!
